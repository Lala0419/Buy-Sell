## User Stories

- A user story describes how users will interact with your application
- They have the form: As a **\_\_**, I want to **\_\_**, because **\_\_**.
- eg. As a user, I want to be able to save posts, because I want to review them later.
- User stories can also be negated: As a **\_**, I shouldn't be able to **\_\_**, because **\_**.
- eg. As a user, I shouldn't be able to edit other users posts, because I don't own those posts.
